**Election Audit Summary**

This script has possible future use for later election exploration or even further exploration of these results. The script could be modified to determine the county with the lowest voter turn out rate in order to improve turn out rate in total. Another modification one could make would be to analyses other county elections in other regions. Modification of the data set called up would be necessary however.
